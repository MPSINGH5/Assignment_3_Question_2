        STORY
    </h1>
    <p class="ad">
        People have been coming to the wise man, complaining about the same problems every time. One day he told them a
        joke and everyone roared in laughter. After a couple of minutes, he told them the same joke and only a few of
        them smiled. When he told the same joke for the third time no one laughed anymore.
    </p>
    <p class="sd">
        The wise man smiled and said:“You can’t laugh at the same joke over and over. So why are you always crying about
        the same problem?”
